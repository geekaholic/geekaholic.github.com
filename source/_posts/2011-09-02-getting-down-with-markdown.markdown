Well recently I've been looking for an alternative [docbook](docbook.org) which I used to use for creating handout notes and developer documentation. At first I thought of trying out [Latex](latex-project.org) since it provides many desktop publishing quality markup and can easily be compiled to a variety of formats such as html, pdf or odt.

Just as I was about to dive into Latex, [Chanux](twitter.com/chanux) pointed me to [Markdown](daringfireball.net/projects/markdown). Hmm, Markdown, I even liked the sound of it. It turns out its even bettter!, its a cutdown version of what resembles wiki syntax. I've always endorsed the [KISS](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) philosophy. After briefly going through the syntax, I relaized I had already used it without actually thinking much about it. That was at [github](github.com) for writing a README.markdown file. Everything about Markdown was all good and the whole [controversy](http://www.zdnet.com/blog/violetblue/when-software-offends-the-pantyshot-package-controversy/509) around the Markdown to html compiler was exactly what the celebrity gossip it needed!
